This is a work in progress project setup. This still needs to add more appropriate dependencies to the pom.xml file, configure application.properties, and implement any additional entities, repositories, services, and controllers as needed.

This structure demonstrates a clear separation of concerns, with distinct layers for the API (controllers), business logic (services), data access (repositories), and data models (entities and REST models). It also shows the use of interfaces and implementations, which can be beneficial for dependency injection and testing.
